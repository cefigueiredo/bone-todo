bone-todo
=========
Simple Backbone and Rails To-do list.

That project is just to practice Backbone and Rails integration, so if do you have something to mention or advice to give... Don't be shy! I'm completelly open to receive advices and critics (I prefer critics with advices to improve my code, please...)

Requirements
------------
I'm using Capybara-Webkit v1.0.0 for view tests. So, for now, its external dependencies are the only required.
The only noted external requisites to install on a MacOSX Lion and a Ubuntu 10.4 was qt4 and firefox browser. See how to install on [Capybara-Webkit Wiki][1]
That project was not tested on a Windows environment, but it's possible to install capybara on Windows too, so if you could test it and tell me... I would appreciate...


How to Help?
-------------
Fork it, use it and say me how it was.

As I said I'm open to improvements. If you see on my code something that could be wrote in a more elegant way... please do a pull request with your advices... 
If for some godness reason I wrote something you just searched for and helped you... please tell me... I will completelly freak out, smile and twitt it for a week maybe!

As I said, i'm not testing on Windows yet... so if you do so... tell me if it works.
